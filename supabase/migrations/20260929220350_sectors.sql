-- Sectors (user, 2026-09-30): the launch flow asks "What sector are you?" (Robotics, Quantum, Finance, AI, Energy,
-- Memory, Space) before "What are you known for?" (the category). Off-chain only: the sector is part of the creator
-- profile JSON (profile v2), whose keccak256 hash the launch pass fixes on-chain, so no contract change.

-- FTF drafts keep the founder's pick until the pass is signed
alter table public.ftf_drafts add column sector text
  check (sector in ('robotics', 'quantum', 'finance', 'ai', 'energy', 'memory', 'space'));
